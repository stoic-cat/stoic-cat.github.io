## Tech

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/), the terminal for the 21st century is amazing, BUT

- Is mostly closed source although the company plans to open source most of the code. See [Open sourcing Warp and business model #400](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/400).
- Can't use it without signing up or logging in to an account. Can't opt out of telemetry either, although it will transition to opt in after they are out of Beta.
- Is currently only out for Mac. Windows and Linux users have to wait and there is no timeline for when it'll be out for those platforms.

## Hobbies

[S-Craft](https://s-craft.studio/) Pokemon Keycaps. Expected delivery date starting 31st Dec 2022.
