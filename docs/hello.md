# Hello

This is a place where I do my brain dump and declutter my mind.

As you can see, this site is still pretty baren as I start to fill it in with more content. That will depend on how much free time (and motivation) I have.

The idea of finding a place to do a brain dump has been stewing in my mind for quite some time and I had been playing with this idea a couple of times with some blog-like static site generators. I ended up only updating those for the first few days before losing interest and motivation as I just couldn't get into the groove and habit of updating it frequently. When I first saw a brain dump from [Nikiv](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/), it felt that the ever WIP and wiki format fit my needs better. What you're reading now is yet another one of my attempts at 'content creation' if you could call it that, as I plan to have this wiki more for my need than others. If someone stumbles upon any of the articles and finds them useful, that'll be a great added bonus too.
