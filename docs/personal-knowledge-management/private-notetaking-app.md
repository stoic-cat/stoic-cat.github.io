# Private Notetaking App

Choosing the ideal private notetaking app based on the following requirements.

## Requirements

- [Future proof](https://sive.rs/plaintext
); Must be in plain text and an open format. e.g. Markdown
- If in Markdown, must be as close to standard Markdown as possible so that it renders well regardless of md viewer
- Definitely no lock in of data
- Supports Linux
- Free. Preferrably open source
- Searchable
- Big plus if it has backlinks

## Contenders

- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
- [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium)
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron)

## Logseq

At first glance, it seems like I have hit the jackpot with Logseq as it is open source and uses local markdown files. However, the deal breaker is that it uses its own specific 'outliner' md format that will not display well in other md viewers. It also [does not take plain md files or allow us to write free-form text](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29688400). It'll be a hard pass for me.

## Trilium

Hierarchical. Don't know enough about it yet. Will have to test. To check if backlinks is supported.

## Zettlr

Don't know enough about it yet. Will have to test. To check if backlinks is supported.

## Joplin

Don't know enough about it yet. Will have to test. To check if backlinks is supported.

## Obsidian

So far it seems to tick all the checkboxes of what I need, except for the fact that Obsidian itself is not open source even though it does take local md files. Will have to test further.

## Dendron

Don't know enough about it yet. Will have to test. But downside is that it relies on a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron). To check if all other options have deal breakers.
